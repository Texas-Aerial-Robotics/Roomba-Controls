roomba_control

Controlling the behaviors of the roomba

HOW TO RUN

Assuming you have catkin, ROS kinetic, Gazebo, etc...

1. Open up a terminal and launch roscore
2. With roscore running, open another terminal.
3. Type . ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash (you can probably make Linux do this automatically with the bash file but I'm not sure how to do that...)
4. Type  roslaunch roomba_control create_world.launch 
5. The sim should launch now. If it doesn't, please let me know!
